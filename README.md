This Asset Pack imports all Quaternius meshes into nanos world.

It contains a map created for testing: `MedievalVillage` and all Quaternius weapons configured for nanos world in `Quaternius/Maps/MedievalVillage/MedievalVillage.lua`.


You can download it and copy the `Content/Quaternius` folder into your Unreal Project to use the references of this Asset Pack in your map! This way people don't need to download this assets twice! We don't recommend modifying the content in `Quaternius/` folder as it wouldn't affect your final exported Asset Pack (it will still use the original Assets from Quaternius Asset Pack).

Some of the assets imported here are still missing some textures, materials and collisions and will be gradually being properly imported and set.
